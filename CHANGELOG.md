# Changelog

This file records user-visible and contract-relevant changes to Common. Detailed commit history remains in Git; this document is for changes that matter to consumers.

## Unreleased

- Promote deterministic ASCII case conversion/comparison for protocol and hardware identifiers.
- Add bounded POSIX lexical dirname beside the existing basename contract.

## 1.19.11 — 2026-09-20

- Added canonical lowercase System/Day/Night persistence keys and case-insensitive parsing to the shared design contract, replacing duplicated consumer serialization logic.
- Added the shared two-decimal GHz formatter used by System Monitor, completing the active frequency-formatting family without a consumer-local scalar wrapper.
- Standardised the documentation baseline across the Infiltrator project family.

## 1.19.7 — 2026-09-19

- Added exact locale-independent finite-decimal cursor-token parsing with unchanged-output failure semantics.
- Exposed canonical native structural design metrics and typography identity through the C adapter.
- Centralised immutable MB Corpo font-asset provenance in reusable CMake metadata without moving font binaries into Common.

## Release history

The repository already records release-specific detail in README.md, release tags and GitHub Releases. Those immutable release records remain authoritative for exact historical source identity.

## Changelog policy

Entries should describe behaviour, not internal activity. Refactoring with no observable contract change needs an entry only when it materially changes maintenance, portability or dependency requirements.
