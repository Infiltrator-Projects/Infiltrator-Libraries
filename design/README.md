# Infiltrator Design

`design/infiltrator-design-v1.json` is the canonical visual contract for graphical Infiltrator software.

The reference implementation is MBLINK. The contract deliberately extracts the reusable parts of MBLINK's presentation rather than Mercedes-specific identity.

## Typography

Owned graphical interfaces use these roles when the faces are available:

- normal UI: `MB Corpo S Title WEB`, weight 400;
- emphasis, actions and section headings: `MB Corpo S Title WEB`, weight 700;
- product/brand display titles: `MB Corpo A Title Cond WEB`, weight 400.

The canonical private/local filenames understood by existing applications are:

- `mb_corpo_a_cond_regular.ttf`;
- `mb_corpo_s_bold.ttf`;
- `mb_corpo_s_regular.ttf`.

Common publishes the canonical family names, role weights, filenames and immutable first-party asset provenance. The general design policy still permits normal platform fallbacks when those faces are unavailable, while a consumer that bundles the exact verified faces may deliberately impose a stricter no-fallback contract. Common does not contain the font binaries themselves.

## Shared structure

The common visual language has two explicit shared palettes: **Night**, the MB graphite/black foundation with the canonical `#00ADEF` accent, and **Day**, its white counterpart using the same accent. Both expose the same semantic roles so controls, states and hierarchy remain consistent across applications without forcing one luminance. **System** is not a third palette: it is a policy requiring the platform adapter to resolve the operating system's current light/dark preference to exactly **Day** or **Night**.

`infiltrator-web-v1.css` is the canonical web adapter for these neutral roles. Existing consumers keep the historical Night values at `:root`; theme-aware consumers set `data-infiltratr-theme="system|day|night"` on the root element. System mode uses `prefers-color-scheme`. The C adapter in `include/infiltratr/design.h` exposes the same Day/Night semantic tokens to native C/C++ consumers while leaving operating-system theme detection to the platform layer.

Product repositories continue to own identity. Manufacturer colours, product accents, icons, logos, illustrations, vehicle gauges and domain-specific components are not part of the shared contract. A product may override the neutral accent while retaining the common typography, structural palette and component metrics.

## Ownership

The JSON remains the canonical design source. A deliberately small, product-neutral C adapter publishes the theme palette, structural metrics and typography identity so native consumers do not need private copies of those values. The accompanying CMake metadata owns immutable font-asset provenance for consumers that package the verified faces; Common still does not own toolkit integration or product-specific styling. Runtime algorithms and broadly reusable C mechanics remain in Common. LINK remains the source of truth for shared vehicle-diagnostics behaviour and shared LINK-family application shells.

When a platform cannot consume the JSON directly, its adapter should mirror these named roles rather than invent a new typography or structural palette. The web adapter is maintained alongside the JSON and regression-checked against its named values so the two cannot silently diverge. Product-specific source should contain only genuine identity overrides.

## Change rule

A design-token change is made here first. The JSON, C adapter and web adapter are regression-checked against one another before consumers move. Consumer-specific exceptions must be intentional and documented; silent drift is a bug. Platform CSS may differ in selector syntax and widget mechanics, but semantic roles and canonical colour values should not.
